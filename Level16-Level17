Task: The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
Commands: echo 'kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx' | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790
Password: Private Key.
