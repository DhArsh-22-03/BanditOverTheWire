Task: The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Look at the commands that logged you into previous bandit levels, and find out how to use the key for this level.
Command: scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/home/bandit13/sshkey.private .
          ls
          ls -la
          chmod 600 sshkey.private
          ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
          cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
